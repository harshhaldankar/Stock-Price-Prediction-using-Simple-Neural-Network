## Description

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a model that can accurately forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open and run the Jupyter notebook `stock_price_prediction.ipynb`.
2. The notebook contains all the necessary steps to load the data, preprocess it, build the model, and make predictions.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading**: Load historical stock price data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Create and train a machine learning model to predict stock prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make stock price predictions.

## Results

The results and visualizations of the predictions are displayed within the notebook.
